-- Here are only the meaningfull interviews:
-- Ruth: Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
-- If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.
--
-- Eugene: I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery,
-- I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
--
-- Raymond: As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
-- Accordingly with the first interview we checked the plates of card leaving the bakery park between 10:15 and 10:25

-- We can finally say that Bruce is the thief cause he took the earliest flight accordigly with the third interview.
-- We can also check the destination of the flight:

-- Destination:
-- New York City;
-- In coclusion Bruce stole the duck and the next day he took a flight to New York City; the ticket was bought by Robin, his accomplice.
